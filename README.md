# School-AES_Encryption
 
Hello,

I realized a cryptography lab whose goal was to find the two keys used during a double AES encryption from the clear message and the final coded message. We had to create our own 32 bytes key and test each time on our plaintext. Thanks to this lab, I could see the huge difference in speed when searching for an item between a list and a dictionary. The difficulty of this lab came from the optimization of the code execution in order to reduce the execution time which is 5 min at least.
